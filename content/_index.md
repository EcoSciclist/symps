# Support for Young Mathematicians and Physical Scientists - "SYMPS"
___________________________

**Assisting talented mathematicians and scientists whose education or career might be suffering for reasons that do not fulfil the prerequisites for assistance imposed by other education charities.** 

We finance carefully tailored interventions in the student or research life of suitable individuals.
___________________________

We invite referrals of able young students and researchers who might be losing their mojo.
* Referrals may be from anyone including the subject herself or himself.
* Most often the referral will be from a teacher, supervisor or professional colleague.
* Referrals by peers, friends or family are equally welcome.

We are also looking for established professionals who would like to help us vet or monitor referrals in exchange for a decidedly modest fee.
___________________________

We collect information from the referrer, the subject (the refered person) and other connected people while always protecting the privacy of all the parties.
___________________________

We consider (taking additional professional advice where appropriate) whether the subject might usefully be helped by an intervention that we are in a position to provide.
___________________________

We select a simple intervention or design a more complex one that we feel meets the needs of the subject and whose efficacy can be effectively monitored by us. We hope that, at this point, the subject becomes a beneficiary.
___________________________

We maintain regular contact during the course of any intervention with all beneficiares and other relevant parties in order to support the beneficiary and to monitor the progress of the intervention.
